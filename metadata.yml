releaseheader: |
  **NOTE:** This release contains breaking changes. Please review the release notes below before upgrading.
  
  The most notable change is that the sending of mail now uses the Mailozaurr module (with MailKit in the backend)
  as the PowerShell team is deprecating the Send-MailMessage cmdlet previously used by PoshEmail.
